Postmortem: Web Application Outage on August 17, 2024

Issue Summary:

- Duration: The outage lasted for 2 hours and 45 minutes, starting at 10:15 AM and ending at 1:00 PM UTC.
- Impact: Our primary e-commerce platform experienced significant slowdowns and intermittent outages, affecting approximately 65% of users. Customers were unable to complete purchases or access product pages, resulting in a 40% drop in hourly sales during the outage.
- Root Cause: A memory leak in the Nginx server caused the web servers to exhaust available memory, leading to process crashes and service unavailability.

Timeline:

- 10:15 AM: Issue detected via automated monitoring alert indicating a spike in server response times.
- 10:20 AM: On-call engineer investigated and confirmed the issue through user complaints and additional monitoring checks.
- 10:30 AM: Initial assumption was a network issue; network team began investigating potential connectivity problems.
- 10:45 AM: Misleading debugging path: Focus shifted to database performance due to high CPU usage on the database server.
- 11:15 AM: Escalated to the DevOps team after network and database investigations yielded no results.
- 11:30 AM: DevOps team identified high memory usage on the Nginx servers, leading to frequent crashes.
- 12:00 PM: Temporary fix applied by restarting Nginx servers and reducing server load through traffic rerouting.
- 12:45 PM: Root cause identified as a memory leak in the latest Nginx update.
- 1:00 PM: Issue resolved by rolling back to the previous stable version of Nginx. Service restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a memory leak introduced in the latest Nginx update deployed the previous night. The leak caused the web servers to progressively consume all available memory, leading to crashes and service interruptions. As more servers were affected, the platform became increasingly slow and unresponsive, particularly during peak usage.

To resolve the issue, the team initially applied a temporary fix by restarting the affected Nginx servers and rerouting traffic to reduce load. However, after identifying the memory leak as the root cause, the decision was made to roll back to the previous stable version of Nginx. This rollback immediately resolved the memory issues, and service was fully restored.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements and fixes identified include the following:

1. Enhance Pre-Deployment Testing:
   - Implement memory leak detection in the pre-deployment testing process for all server updates.
   - Expand the scope of testing to include longer runtime simulations to catch issues that may develop over time.

2. Improve Monitoring and Alerts:
   - Add more granular memory usage alerts for Nginx servers to detect anomalies earlier.
   - Integrate automated rollback mechanisms in case of similar issues in the future.

3. Documentation and Communication:
   - Document the issue and the fix in the internal knowledge base for future reference.
   - Improve communication between teams to ensure quicker identification of root causes during incidents.

Tasks to Address the Issue:

- Patch Nginx Server: Apply a permanent fix for the memory leak once available.
- Add Monitoring on Server Memory: Implement new memory monitoring alerts across all servers.
- Update Pre-Deployment Testing: Integrate memory leak detection into the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
- Enhance Incident Response Training: Conduct training sessions to improve response times and reduce the chances of misleading debugging paths.

By addressing these issues, we aim to prevent similar outages and improve the resilience of our platform.
